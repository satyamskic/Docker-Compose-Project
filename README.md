My Docker project
I created project based on Ghost which is open source blogging platform.



What is ghost and Why we need it ??

Ghost is a NodeJS module for creating Blogs something like WordPress. It's initial release was on Octorber 2013, and was John O'Nolan. Ghost is built using NodeJS, which means it is a lot faster then typical PHP server or WordPress.
It uses popular express that is it's server and for a database you can select between SQLite or MySQL. It also has a nice templating enginer called Handlebars. In order to word with ghost you just need to know Markdown, thats it, nothing else,and if you want to develop application or plugins then you need 
to know JavaScript.
