I'll also show you how to setup for create this project but before it i would like to give you quick introduction about ghost...........




# What is ghost and Why we need it ??

Ghost is a **NodeJS** module for creating Blogs something like WordPress. It's initial release was on **Octorber 2013**, and was **John O'Nolan**. Ghost is built using NodeJS, which means it is a lot faster then typical PHP server or WordPress.
It uses popular express that is it's server and for a database you can select between **SQLite** or **MySQL**. It also has a nice templating enginer called **Handlebars**. In order to word with ghost you just need to know **Markdown**, thats it, nothing else,and if you want to develop application or plugins then you need to know **JavaScript**.
